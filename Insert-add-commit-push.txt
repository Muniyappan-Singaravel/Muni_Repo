whil cloning a repository from git it creates two different files in local machine one is local repository 
and another one is working file, 

If we create any file or folder in the same repo while working means it will be created in local file,

1. --> git init --> to initialize the current folder in git
2. --> git status --> this is to check whether the file is moved to staging or not 
        it must show as Unranked Files:

3. --> while file is in working folder git status will show untracked
    --> add file -> now first we have to move that file git staging  -> (git add fileName)
        
    --> commit file -> then we have to to move that file to local repository -> (git commit -m "commit message")
        
    --> push file -> after doing all this we have to use push tthis to main (online) repository 
            -> (git push origin main) -> this tells to push the file to origin (to the storage of same url 
                which we used to clone and in thee main branch)
