whil cloning a repository from git it creates two different files in local machine one is local repository 
and another one is working file, 

If we create any file or folder in the same repo while working means it will be created in local file,

1. --> git init --> to initialize the current folder in git
2. --> git status --> this is to check whether the file is moved to staging or not 
        it must show as Unranked Files:

3. --> while file is in working folder git status will show untracked
    --> add file -> now first we have to move that file git staging  -> (git add fileName)
        
    --> commit file -> then we have to to move that file to local repository -> (git commit -m "commit message")
        
    --> push file -> after doing all this we have to use push tthis to main (online) repository 
            -> (git push origin main) -> this tells to push the file to origin (to the storage of same url 
                which we used to clone and in thee main branch)


Now lets do some modification in this ssame file.
        And also know it will get updates in original file in GitHub.

now this is modified file
        To update this in a original GitHub file  follw the same procedure.
        git add file name --> this moves updated file to staging area
        git commit -m commit message --> this moves updated file to local repository
        git push origin main --> this moves updated file to GitHub repository

Delate File:
        Deleting a file from working repository, and then you want to delete the same file from 
        local repo and also from Git repo means, then we have to follow the same procedure

        1st -> delete the file here in IDE
        2nd -> git add file name --> this moves updated repository (deleted one) to a staging area
        3rd -> git commit -m "commit message" --> this updates deletion in local repo
        4th -> git push origin main --> this updates the delete operation in git repo
